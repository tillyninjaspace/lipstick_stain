            <h1>About Lipstick Stain</h1>
            <p>After moving to San Luis Obispo County, I became more interested
                in learning more about wine. With my husband, we'd go explore local wineries in
                Edna Valley and Paso Robles, where many wineries are in San Luis Obispo County.
                Some wineries would offer a unique ambiance like one that's a castle, some that have 
                acres and acres of vineyards for you to view as you're sipping on your wine. We've
                also tasted wines in Arroyo Grande and Grover Beach. See our All Wine Places section to 
                see all of my personal reviews.
            </p>

                Leaving lipstick stains on their wine glasses, I'd take in the flavors and uniqueness
                of each winery and vineyard and write my opinions here.

            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>Even as a native Californian, before I started my life here, I had generalized and thought that everything north of California is like the bay area
                but San Luis Obispo County is not like Northern California. It is the Central Coast of Calfornia and so much slower
                paced than the big cities north or south of this county. We have an abundant of food and drink that is grown
                here and it's oh so beautiful! Homes are still expensive but still notably less than homes in Southern California
                and Northen California.
