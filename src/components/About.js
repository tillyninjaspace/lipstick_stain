            <h1>About Lipstained Glass Wine Reviews</h1>
            <p>I became a wine enthusiast after moving to the San Luis Obispo (SLO) County area. With hundreds of wineries
                in the area here surrounded by a lot of farm land, the easy access of getting wine straight from the source 
                in this environment is a gift so I started an adventure of wine tasting. At first, I wasn't sure if I'd fit in as a stay at home mom who 
                is usually in casual wear. I went to my first winery with an expectation that it was going
                to be mainly the rich and fancy wearing nice dresses to do wine tasting like the places I visited in Napa Valley.
                It is not like that here on a normal week day but you will find special groups or bachelor/bachelorette parties who do come dressed well.
                Tastings are half the prices of the wineries in Napa Valley and the grapes that are used to make
                the wine are grown and produced here. Some of these wines are renowned award winners!
            </p>
            <p>There is a unique culture here. It's laid back like where I grew up but much more rural with 
                beautiful hills and beaches that just all exist in one county. Sometimes I'd be at the beach and see both
                in one take. It's a true sanctuary for those who need  it.
            </p>
            <p>All of the wineries I've visited so far are family-friendly, some more friendly than others which I'll
                note in my reviews. See all of my reviews
                on one page under <a href="/wineries">All Wine Places</a>.</p>

            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>Even as a native Californian, before I started my life here, I had generalized things. This is the Central Coast of Calfornia and it's so much slower
                paced than the big cities north or south of this county. We have an abundant of food and drink that is grown
                here and it's oh so beautiful! Homes are still expensive but still notably less than homes in Southern California
                and Northen California.
