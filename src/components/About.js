            <h1>About Lipstick Stain</h1>
            <p>After moving to San Luis Obispo County, I became more interested
                in learning more about wine. With my husband, we'd go explore local wineries in
                Edna Valley and Paso Robles, where many wineries are in San Luis Obispo County.
                Some wineries would offer a unique ambiance like one that is castle, some that have 
                acres and acres of vineyards for you to view as you're sipping on your wine. We've
                also tasted wines in Arroyo Grande and Grover Beach. See our Wine Place section to 
                see all of my personal reviews.
            </p>

                Leaving lipstick stains on their wine glasses, I'd take in the flavors and uniqueness
                of each winery and vineyard and write my opinions here.

                Please drink responsibly and take an uber when you're feeling that it's unsafe to drive.
