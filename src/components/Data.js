        {"id":11,"name":"Justin's Tasting Room","description":"Located in downtown Paso Robles, Justin's Tasting Room is elegant and beautiful. A friend of ours invited us as his guests for a tasting as he was a wine club member and we were really impressed with the place. I felt like I was underdressed as I saw a really beautiful and fancy couple sitting there! Their wines are wonderful and they are an award winning winery. If you're staying in downtown Paso Robles, I highly recommend trying a tasting experience here. You'll be close to a lot of restaurants within walking distance.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/day-trip-to-paso-robles","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/a9833267-6982-4c25-9347-94c3ab49813d","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628802118/chyusay4fzsghdactfp7.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":2,"name":"Vina Robles Vineyards & Winery","description":"Vina Robles is located in Paso Robles, among 300 other wineries. However, this one is very special. It has a beautiful and big tasting room, a separate member's only area and special perks for becoming a wine club member. They also own an amphitheater where many top musicians perform. As an extra perk, you get to go to exclusive events and get first pick on reserving these events.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/wine-release-party-at-vina-robles-vineyards","picture":null,"productimage":"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1d/9e/23/1d9e23b11c7d46e250cae2668dc26244.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":3,"name":"Kelsey See Canyon Vineyards","description":"Wine Tasting at Kelsey See Canyon Vineyards is a very unique experience! They have peacocks roaming around here! You can see and hear them as you're enjoying your taste. Another great thing about this place is they let us bring a picnic without requiring us to purchase a bottle. As long as we're doing tastings there, it was fine. Just remember to clean up after yourselves. Our food did attract a lot of flies so that is one thing to consider while picnicking there as it has a creek right by it.","location":"Avila area in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/review-and-pictures-of-kelsey-see-canyon-vineyards-in-slo","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/e53d634c-d1cb-40ed-919d-3ab6a9b26adb","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628698899/ozk1j2bzfbdnylqdijfn.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":1,"name":"Tolosa Winery","description":"Tolosa Winery is located in Edna Valley and close to the airport. The tasting room is surrounded by hundreds of beautiful vineyards and their wines are wonderful. We loved it so much that we became wine club members during our first visit! They have fantastic events and high class service. They also have a Tesla Charging area!","location":"Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/tolosa-winery","picture":null,"productimage":"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2d/10/76/2d1076a1dfb354c262c6eb3c6bc77831.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":4,"name":"Tooth and Nail Winery","description":"This wine place is a castle! You have to visit here. If you're on limited time and can only narrow to one place in Paso Robles, Tooth and Nail Winery is it! It is so beautiful with a moat. Kids were not allowed inside the tasting room but if you have them in tow, you can have tastings outside with them. There are seatings outside.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/tooth-and-nail-winery-in-paso-robles-review","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/bdab7204-476e-4da5-9915-96ea265f7565","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628702143/dacx3tzrsqpjqmxxkifg.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":5,"name":"Edna Valley Winery","description":"Located in Edna Valley, you'll need to get on a side road to get here. It has a pretty tasting room but you can't sit inside unless you're a member so you'll have to stand while you're tasting their wine or sit outside. They do have a pretty outside area so that's not all bad. Maybe things have changed now but when we were there, they didnâ€™t allow us to sit inside the tasting room for our tastings as we were not club members. However, when outside, the view is phenomenal.","location":"Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/d3f54dd4-6a08-4931-afe5-908287894718","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628726758/l1pr1euhoabhwndp0m5r.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":6,"name":"Chamisal Vineyards","description":"Chamisal has a great view of the vineyards and it has a nice outdoor space. Their indoor tasting room is quite small so be ready to sit outside when you come here for a tasting. They have one of the best chardonnays in the area!","location":"Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/ecde33a6-0596-4cb2-8c12-69c6eceb172b","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628738866/ql1gfvco2ecmk6lz7urs.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":7,"name":"Baileyana, Tangent and Truth Myth Tasting Room","description":"The great thing about Baileyana, Tangent and Truth Myth Tasting Room is you can taste all three different wine companies at one place. Our favorite of the bunch is Baileyana, especially the SBAR Pinot Noir! This place is also beautiful and and has a nice outdoor space. We also came here for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful time.","location":"Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/890f16f0-f2d4-475f-add6-8b1bcc21eba5","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628739617/prcunwybytr5exlbspap.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":8,"name":"Autry Cellars","description":"Located in Edna Valley, Autry Cellars has a very small tasting room but there is a bit of space outdoors. They don't sell any of their wines at a store so you can only find Autry wine here at their tasting room! This makes this place a very special visit and very exclusive. It wouldn't be one of my top places to bring the kids but they won't turn you away if you have them with you.","location":"Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/8b6b5244-9c2b-4537-a496-714e5372e39c","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628740360/jgtgcsctea1tynwymtzc.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":10,"name":"Bianchi Winery & Tasting Room","description":"Bianchi was a more memorable tasting trip as they have a pond with hundreds of fishes when we visited! The view of the vineyards was also breathtaking and I can see how this place would be a great place to have a rehearsal dinner or wedding. It feels secluded and special for grand events.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/day-trip-to-paso-robles","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/b2f085dd-33b1-4e20-93ad-a3b3a27c36ce","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628778573/kwp1xmgiwge38iv2su3g.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":9,"name":"Wolff Winery","description":"We came to Wolff Winery while they were having a band playing and it was very busy! There was a lunch truck there for this very event. You can see lines of vineyards from here, which makes this place a great place for photos. I would look out for their events here if you're looking for a winery with a bit of entertainment.","location":"Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/6f34144e-7093-4266-97f2-e11bd7cbf7b9","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628740728/kuqjaxckeb1pcbl3dhtc.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":12,"name":"Eberle Winery","description":"Free tastings and cave tours at Eberle Winery attract a lot of tourists! It can get really busy really quickly here. I believe they are asking for a $10 reservation fee if you're reserving online but that goes towards your wine purchase. However, we came here before the pandemic and there was no reservation fee or anything. It was absolutely free to taste. They do offer a veteran's discount so do ask for that if you're a veteran and plan on getting a bottle. The cave tour is worth the visit!","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/c2a76018-0f99-4f8a-8edf-f28bde578b5b","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628802396/iesrzt3kznjuuxyr3svo.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":20,"name":"Ancient Peaks Winery","description":"Located in Santa Margarita, this place was sub-par but they made up the experience by bringing a oyster shell fossil to show us. One advice is maybe take into the traditional 'ladies first' mentality when pouring like other wineries in Paso Robles and Edna Valley.","location":"Santa Margarita, California","link":"","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/9945c9dc-d7f6-4e8d-a89e-0ceaa6e89766","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1630265901/ys8x07fbiv04a5jyadup.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":14,"name":"Laetitia Vineyard & Winery","description":"This winery is off the road from the 101 and secluded. Be careful to not miss the turn! Upon speaking about this winery, I kept seeing a 2 for 1 tasting coupon showing up on facebook so you may find it pop up too! Take advantage of that offer. There are wonderful picnic tables here which made it great for the kids for picnicking! We enjoyed bringing our own lunches while enjoying a tasting here.","location":"Arroyo Grande, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRGA3qXFqjG/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/225f44e9-7890-45c2-b12d-0a9e724c0bba","productimage":"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5d/90/74/5d9074f4e6ec3906bd3e3ce2d741b572.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":13,"name":"Calcareous Winery","description":"This winery is secluded and up a hill in Paso Robles. The road up is windy and narrow; not for the faint heart like me. I was nervous riding up here. However, the view from up high is pretty amazing. I don't know if I'd want to drive all the way up here just for the view again. Only because I'm such a wimpy person when it comes to heights. For those up for an adventure and would like a view up high, Calcareous is the spot.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/4af434e6-34c4-457a-b01e-cf6de340f486","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1628820111/uv4zl4bay83cyocuadl5.png","active":true},
        {"id":15,"name":"Talley Vineyards","description":"Talley Vineyards is located in Arroyo Grande and kind of in the middle of nowhere. Talley owns acres and acres of farm land so you'll see a lot more than just vineyards. They have a cute courtyard area at Talley Vineyards but we enjoyed our tastings inside. Their members only lounge is adults only so kids aren't allowed in the lounge. However, kids are allowed in the tasting room area. When we were there pre-covid, they had toys in the back corner. This place is quite popular for locals.","location":"Arroyo Grande, California","link":"http://www.sanluisobispomom.com/blog/talley-vineyards-review","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/5e5d9533-ac8d-4a40-a8a2-77af6a4b205d","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1629341626/lfn3z40s2scjbyrhf3ok.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":18,"name":"Timbre Winery Tasting Room","description":"Located at Arroyo Grande Village, this tasting room is a few minutes walk to so many excellent restaurants. I wouldn't go out of my way just to coming to this tasting room but it's definitely worth checking out if you're already going to be in the Arroyo Grande Village area. You have to walk up with a bit of an incline to get to the steps of the tasting room so I'd be wary of that if you have bad knees.","location":"Arroyo Grande, California","link":"","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/0a44ca13-fd56-4c29-a09c-887a73b535f1","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1629633760/v74ofwmgpylzlp2ees4p.png","active":true},
        {"id":16,"name":"Pear Valley Estate Wines","description":"We made a reservation to Pear Valley Estates Wines as it was close to the Ravine Water Park (only 5 min away). This tasting room is beautiful with wonderful views and a lot of award winning wines. Their Merlot surprised me! Service was great and the place was definitely family-friendly. They have a really nice and spacious outdoor area.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CS392hpHm1L/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/badbe629-1f34-4ff8-8928-008d8403432c","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1629631583/vtrrjeqkczwtrlmjytk5.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":19,"name":"Monarch Grove Winery Tasting Room","description":"Located in Grover Beach, this tasting room is right off the train tracks at the train station and a block from the ocean! If you're waiting for your ride home from the train stop anyway, this is a great place to spend a bit of time at. The wines are a bit sweeter than what I'm used to but the location is convenient. Also, I love the name as it's located right down the street from the Monarch Butterfly Grove!","location":"Grover Beach, California","link":"","picture":"blob:http://localhost:3000/a49ac0c1-c36b-41b3-b519-8b5b0ed8bd4c","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1629754574/gi7b9bssi0zg6zddjjwh.jpg","active":true},{"id":17,"name":"Steinbeck Vineyards & Winery","description":"Don't let the tractors deter you! They have a welcoming tasting room! Reservations are highly recommended here and they close at 4PM, earlier than some of the wineries nearby but their tastings were amazing! Service was personable and it was very interesting to see the artifacts around the walls. Their indoor tasting room is a standing tasting room. It definitely had a unique vibe and is worth checking out!","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CS4AcqeH58C/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/e5581824-ba74-4ef9-a0e8-ccfeab23cfab","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1629632270/qvscqeomolbouhklys8e.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":22,"name":"Cass Winery","description":"Cass Winery has a cute garden you can walk through to see what they're growing to use as ingredients in their food. You can also see some chicken walking around and eating some squash. Their food at the winery is actually really delicious but it made me feel a little guilty watching these chickens. We actually tasted their wine from buying a bottle from a local VONS first and liked it so much that this became a must visit to taste straight from the source for us.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUQ2NEppcAy/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/d7fc8090-00d3-4263-9828-b6ac030e5348","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1632613342/ef38vjnvxia8cwtwwx8x.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":21,"name":"Rava Wines","description":"To be honest, we only visited this place because it was included in our wine passport that we purchased from the Atascadero Chamber of Commerce. This Paso Robles winery has a free walking trail through the vineyards which made it very inviting. They also serve great food on the weekends. Best of all, they have great red and white wines. It is kind of in the middle of nowhere but wine enthusiasts will enjoy this place!","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUQdJcDv7MU/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/f4a7138d-c73f-46ce-a655-db17cec7ea5a","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1632601028/urpcsegfkevnablmandn.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":23,"name":"Castoro Cellars","description":"Castoro Cellars is beautiful! From the drive in to the walk to the front entrance, it will impress anyone visiting here. I highly recommend getting a reservation. People leave here with bottles! They have amazing wine and amazing service. They also have special events for wine club members including concerts.","location":"Templeton, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUiuVTTJ91T/?utm_medium=copy_link","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/841de731-e02a-436c-919e-b56573f3a4b7","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1633211195/q6tzvyu0ykwr6qnfk4uf.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":27,"name":"Sculpterra Winery and Sculpture Garden","description":"Among the many top wineries in Paso Robles, Sculpture Winery is easily my top 5 favorite because of the art! The beautiful garden surrounds the tasting room. There is a lot to look at and places to walk. Tasting room is a standing tasting room so no chairs if you are tasting. Although with supervision, the kids can roam outside, if you're tasting you'll have to stay inside. And with no seats inside, this is definitely one of the least kid-friendly places on the list. You can see my video reel @lipstainedglass via instagram.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChNkamaASYG/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/9ed53d75-4800-40a0-bf5e-11eb8eda267e","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1660489482/eejkcurfooslpjwr7jqz.jpg","active":true},
        {"id":24,"name":"Ecluse Wines","description":"Expect to stand in this tasting room in Paso Robles! You'll have to go on a windy dirt road to get here but the Vineyards views make it worth it. There were barrels surrounding the tasting room and we were poured a sample of a syrah straight from the barrel, which was really neat. The place was already almost full right when they just opened on the Saturday when we came in. It was also fun to see a Bachelorette party stopping in here too.","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"https://www.instagram.com/lipstainedglass/","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/3499c1f3-e8bd-4845-9a92-a91fae18e8cf","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1633281267/sp76aoijcifoi6xyzcul.jpg","active":true},

Their tasting room is indoors and it's a standing tasting room. However, you can sit outside in between pours if you prefer. They also have a food menu but it is also only served outdoors. We came there during Thanksgiving week and they have their Christmas tree up!","location":"Paso Robles, California","link":"","picture":"blob:https://lipstainedglass.com/f288db06-1639-42dd-a9ce-b606d9527942","productimage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/ninjaspacecontent/image/upload/v1637810223/mrapyweja3srq7hils05.jpg","active":true},
