            <p>I became more interested in learning about wine tasting after moving to San Luis Obispo County. With my husband, 
                we'd go explore local wineries in Edna Valley and Paso Robles, where many wineries are in San Luis Obispo County and
                bring a picnic.
                Some wineries would offer a unique ambiance like one that's a castle or some that have 
                acres and acres of vineyards for you to view as you're sipping on your wine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With each taste from my glass, I'd take in the flavors and uniqueness
                of each winery and tasting room and write my opinions here. See our <a href="/wineries"
                title="Reviews of Wineries in San Luis Obispo and Paso Robles"
                >All Wine Places</a> section to 
                see all of my personal reviews or select a winery or tasting room below.
