            <p>Before I moved to the San Luis Obispo County area, I wasn't a wine enthusiast. With hundreds of wineries
                in the area here surrounded by a lot of farm land, the easy access of getting wine straight from the source 
                is a gift so I started an adventure of wine tasting. At first, I wasn't sure if I'll fit in as a stay at home mom who 
                is usually in casual wear. I went to my first winery with an expectation that it was going
                to be mainly the rich and fancy, wearing nice dresses to do wine tasting like the places I visited in Napa Valley.
                It is not like that here on a normal week day but you will find special groups or bachelore/bachelorette parties who do come dressed well.
                Tastings are half the prices of the wineries in Napa Valley and the grapes that are used to make
                the wine are grown and produced here. Some of these wines are renowned award winners!
            </p>
            <p>There is a unique culture here. It's laid back like where I grew up in San Diego but much more rural with 
                beautiful hills and beaches that just all exist in one county. Sometimes I'd be at the beach and see both
                in one take. It's a true sanctuary for those who need  it.
            </p>
            <p>All of the wineries I've visited so far are family-friendly, some more friendly than others which I'll
                note in my reviews. Select from the winery/tasting room list below to read my reviews or see all of my reviews
